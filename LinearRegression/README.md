# Linear Regression Model
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn. Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts a continuous target variable based on the linear relationship with one or more predictor variables.

## About the Model
Linear Regression is a basic and widely-used algorithm in machine learning for predicting a target variable based on a linear relationship with one or more predictors. It is defined by the equation:
                               y=mx+c
where:
- y is the predicted target variable,
- X is the predictor variable,
- c is the intercept (bias),
- m is the coefficient (slope) of the predictor.
The model in this repository uses scikit-learn's LinearRegression class to fit the model to the data and make predictions.

## Dataset
The model uses randomly generated data to simulate the relationship between X (input feature) and y (output variable).

- X: Input feature, generated as random values.
- y: Target variable, generated based on the formula y=4+3X with added noise for realism.

## Dependencies
To run this model, you need Python and the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
  - pip install numpy scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/BOYAKOLLAIGEETHA/MachineLearning-Models.git
   cd linear-regression-model
2. Run the model:
   python linear_regression.py

## Result
After running the model, youâ€™ll get the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the test data, which indicates how well the model fits. Additionally, it outputs the intercept and coefficient values.
